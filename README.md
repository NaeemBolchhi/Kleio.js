# Kleio.js
Kleio, better known as Clio, is one of the nine muses in Greek mythology. She is the muse of history. Kleio.js is a very simplistic JS library for my personal projects. It will only consist of various functions that I frequently use in my projects, simplifying my experience.

## Usage
Kleio has functions for both the `<head>` tag and the `<body>` tag. Therefore, it is best to load Kleio.js as early as possible, preferably as the first child in your `<head>` tag.

You can add the following bit inside your `<head>` tag, at the very top.
> ```<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NaeemBolchhi/Kleio.js/main/kleio.js"></script>```

You probably won't need Kleio.js, but if you do, look at the comments inside the JS file to see which function does what. I won't be documenting anywhere else since this is not going to be anything ambitious. Good luck with your projects!
