# Kleio.js
Kleio, better known as Clio, is one of the nine muses in Greek mythology. She is the muse of history. Kleio.js is a very simplistic JS library for my personal projects. It will only consist of various functions that I frequently use in my projects, simplifying my experience.

You probably won't need Kleio.js, but if you do, look at the comments inside the JS file to see which function does what. I won't be documenting anywhere else since this is not going to be anything ambitious. Good luck with your projects!
